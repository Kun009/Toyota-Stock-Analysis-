Toyota Motors has a rich history of stock market performance, reflecting its position as a global leader in the automotive industry. However, analyzing stock trends and trading activity over decades can be challenging due to the sheer volume of daily trading data. This dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive solution to address this challenge, enabling investors, analysts, and stakeholders to gain actionable insights into stock performance, price volatility, and trading volume patterns.

The dashboard features:  
- **Key Metrics**: Average Close Price, Open Price, High Price, Low Price, Volume, and Adjusted Close Price.  
- **Volatility Analysis**: Insights into daily price fluctuations to highlight trading risks.  
- **Aggregate Stock Price Trends**: A historical overview of price movements and trading patterns.  
- **Yearly Analysis**: Year-over-year trends for stock prices and trading volumes, offering a high-level perspective on Toyotaâ€™s market performance.

By leveraging Tableau, I demonstrated my ability to analyze, aggregate, and visualize large datasets in a meaningful way. This project highlights advanced skills, including developing calculated fields for metrics like volatility, creating visually compelling dashboards, and implementing filters for exploratory analysis. The result is an intuitive and data-driven story that empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions.

This dashboard showcases my proficiency in data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, demonstrating my readiness to tackle complex data challenges and provide valuable insights for organizational success.
